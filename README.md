# 🚀 Secure Communication Framework for E-Governance Application

> **Mini Project | Simplified Implementation**
> A lightweight Node.js-based framework demonstrating secure, encrypted, and authenticated data exchange between a client and server — ideal for e-governance or digital service applications.

---

## 🔒 Project Overview

Modern e-governance systems handle sensitive citizen data — from ID verification to document transfer.
This project showcases a **secure communication model** that combines **HTTPS**, **JWT Authentication**, and **Hybrid Encryption (RSA + AES)** to ensure data privacy and integrity.

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **HTTPS Secure Server** – Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
✅ **JWT Authentication** – Stateless and token-based access control
✅ **Hybrid Encryption** – RSA for key exchange, AES for data encryption
✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Restricts actions based on roles (e.g., Admin/User)
✅ **Audit Logging** – Records every critical transaction securely

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/secure-comm-framework.git
cd secure-comm-framework
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install express jsonwebtoken axios
```

### 3️⃣ Generate SSL Certificates (for local testing)

```bash
cd certificates
bash make_dev_ca.sh
cd ..
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Server

```bash
node server/server.js
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Client

```bash
node client/client.js
```

---

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Client** requests authentication → receives a **JWT token**.
2. **Client** encrypts data using **AES**, and encrypts AES key with **RSA**.
3. **Server** decrypts the data, verifies JWT, and processes it.
4. **Actions** are recorded in `logs/audit.log` for security auditing.

---

## 🧠 Use Case Example

Imagine a **citizen portal** where:

* Citizens upload encrypted documents.
* Government officers access them securely using verified tokens.
* Every upload/view/download is logged for transparency.

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

* 🔹 Database integration (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
* 🔹 Multi-user role hierarchy
* 🔹 End-to-end message integrity checks
* 🔹 Web dashboard for audit visualization
